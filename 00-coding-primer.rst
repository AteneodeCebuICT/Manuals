SHS-ADC ICT Coding Primer
=========================

The Ateneo de Cebu - ICT Team develops technology-based solutions that
aims to…

1. Enhance the teaching and learning process by developing applications
   that can either be used in the classroom or as a tool that helps the
   teachers in preparing their lessons
2. Increase the productivity of the faculty and staff by developing
   applications that cater to the needs of the school community
3. Solve problems and needs that are very difficult to do without the
   use of computer algorithms.

Methodologies
-------------

The team tries to follow `Agile Software Development`_ as much as
possible.

The needs of the school community may change very easily and very
quickly. The team tries to be flexible and be *agile* enough to deliver
the needs of the school.

Required Skills
---------------

-  The Passion to Learn
-  The Passion to Serve
-  The Passion to Lead
-  **MAGIS** - Being *more* or doing your best in everything you do!

The team does not strictly require anything except for the above.
Everything else follows if you have those.

Recommended Skills
------------------

Though the team does not require anything, the following skills will be
very useful:

1. HTML/CSS - Most current and future applications will be based on
   web technologies. Hence, knowledge of *HTML* and *CSS* markup is very
   important.
2. `Python`_ - Majority of the current system and future systems
   will be built using *Django* - a web framework written in Python.
3. `MariaDB`_/`MySQL`_ - The database that is used in many projects.
4. Javascript - It is very important that educational applications
   have great *UX/UI*. This can only be achieved through the use of
   *HTML*, *CSS*, and *Javascript*.
5. Visual Basic for Applications - Some legacy applications written
   in *MS Excel* or *MS Access VBA* are still being maintained by the
   team. Due to *MS Office*\ ’s familiarity and ease of use, this
   platform may still be used as a frontend to some future projects.
6. **Linux** - most applications are deployed to an *Ubuntu Server* so
   knowledge of the *Linux* command line is very useful for
   administering the server.

The above skills are chosen based from the current projects of the team.
That list may still grow longer as more and more projects are being
developed.

Currently, the following frameworks/libraries are being used in the
projects:

1. `Django`_ - This is the web framework built in *Python* that the
   team uses for its server-side systems. It enables fast development
   and delivery of features.
2. `AngularJS`_ - This is the JS framework that is used to enhance
   the functionality on the frontend.
3. `Bootstrap`_ - This is the standard HTML/CSS framework that is
   used.
4. `jQuery`_ - Used in adding functionality to the frontend.

.. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/

Knowledge of any following technologies is also very useful since the
team is planning to use these in upcoming projects:

1. `PostgreSQL`_ - as a replacement for MySQL for relational data
2. `Ionic`_ - for building mobile apps
3. `MongoDB`_/`CouchDB`_ - for use as a database in applications
   that have document-oriented data
4. `Socket.io`_ - for building *live* web applications that needs
   server-client realtime communication.

Recommended Tools
-----------------

-  `Sublime Text 3`_ - Standard code editor. Easy to learn. Easy to
   customize.
-  `Git`_ - Every development project needs proper version control.
   *Git* enables the team to collaborate more efficiently on projects.
-  `SourceTree`_ - GUI for *Git*.
